				<h3>Marshall</h3>
					<p>The most consistent site in SoCal (and maybe Earth?) and is a great place for peoiple who like to get high and go XC.</p>

				<h3>Mentone</h3>
					<p>When it's blowing north due to Santa Ana Conditions this site can often be a reliable back-up to Marshall and Soboba.  Located almost directly between the two sites, it is sheltered by Big Bear Mountain and is often flown in winter.</p>

				<h3>Elsinore</h3>
					<p>One of the few North-East facing launches, this site can typically be a great convergence site with record altitudes</p>

				<h3>Blossom</h3>
					<p>Similar to Soboba in that it can be thermic but also a good ridge soaring site, this site requires the ability to top land</p>
