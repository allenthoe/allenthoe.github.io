		<h2>Paragliding Training Syllabus(P-2)</h2> 
<h4>Disclaimer:</h4><p>  Like all forms of aviation, paragliding is dangerous and accidents can result in injury and/or death.  Pilots who take up the sport of paragliding will have to assume this risk and will be expected to adhere to the guidelines set forth by their school and USHPA.  
Though instructors are a strong influence on when it is safe to fly and will do what they can to prevent an accident, the pilot is always the last to choose if it is safe to fly or not.  
The choice to fly is always up to the pilot.<p><br>

<h4>Overview: </h4><p>As part of the Paragliding training, we will start from day 1 as though each pilot has no formal paragliding training or experience.  Along with instruction, tandem flights, simulators and ground school we will prepare you to get to the level of being able to fly on your own, unsupervised.  At the end of the course, we will expect you to be at the P2 (novice) level where you can fly at most sites under good conditions.  Limits of operation are listed at the end of this syllabus and are posted on the USHPA website.
</p><h4>Course progression:</h4> <p> Below is the sequence of events for the paragliding instruction course.  The time-line for each student will vary.  It is not a matter of time, it is a matter of proficiency.  When you can demonstrate that you understand and have mastered the skill required to do each piece, you can move forward.  Progression should not move forward if there is a problem with the step before.  This is your life on the line!  Never hesitate to ask questions!  
*Some of the skills required will depend on conditions.  As conditions change, I may change the order of some of the skills learning to take advantage of current conditions.

<li>Visual contact with the landing zone.</li>
<li>Avoid application of either brake beyond 2/3 of the way from slack to stall position.</li>
<li>Limit turns to 30° of bank, limit speed in turns to 1.5 times the straight line, brakes off, cruise speed, and smoothly exit any spiral turn which shows a tendency to steepen or accelerate.</li>
<li>Should fly a canopy recommended by the manufacturer as rated as Beginner /Intermediate </li></ul>

<h4>Additional Study Resources:</h4>
<p>Aside from training with me, you should be studying on your own.  Websites, youtube, vimeo, books, magazines and talking with other pilots will help you increase your knowledge and speed up your training in a safe manner.  Though some concepts will be beyond you at the beginning (thermalling techniques for example) it is never too early to start learning and investigating the air.  Though you will start off in smooth air with little turbulence, you will eventually seek rising air which will be accompanied by turbulence and possible deflations (collapses) that need to be studied in order to be handled appropriately.   DO NOT attempt to fly in thermic conditions under any circumstance until you have consulted with your instructor and had the proper training to do so.  Studying videos like Flybubble or The Paragliding Manual will increase your bank of knowledge and help you bring meaning to situations as they arise.
</p><p><em>Words to the wise:</em>
  Being a pilot is a life-long journey and you will never stop learning.  At no point will you be a master of the sky.  The sky will always determine whether you soar or sink out, whether it's bumpy or smooth air and whether you land safely or not.  We can do our best to increase our chances and mitigate risk by making calculated decisions and listening to our gut instincts.  
  </p><p><strong>Be cautious of your eagerness to fly.</strong>  The <em>decision</em> to fly is the most important decision you will make every day.  Your ability to choose not to fly will be more respected by pilots than your decision to be brave and fly in questionable conditions, against your gut instincts.  Just because other pilots are flying, doesn't mean it is safe for you.   They have different experience levels, site knowledge, and equipment than you.  Only you can know how well you can fly on a day to day basis!  Group effect can be a dangerous motivation to fly in our sport.  Never go against your gut when making the decision to launch.  Always stick to what you are comfortable and "<em>don't be the first penguin!</em>"	-Wallace Anderson

  <h4>Pre-Solo Flight Standards:</h4>
<ol><li><strong>Canopy layout and connection:</strong> (Students can layout canopy, clear their lines and connect while facing the wing and then how to check for riser twists).</li>
<li><strong>Forward inflations:</strong>  Student will be able to consistently inflate the canopy, use small immediate corrections to help inflate and check the wing with brakes before it overshoots/frontals.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse inflations:</strong> Student can consistently launch reverse, maintain control and balance the wing BEFORE turning around to launch.</li>
<li><strong>Kiting Techniques:</strong> Student can kite the wing both forwards and backwards, with and without looking at the wing, bring the wing up and down using the A's and C's and keep the wing up by walking under the wing.  Student can kite with and without brakes.</li>
<li><strong>Deflations techniques:</strong>  Student will be able to consistently stall the wing with it falling behind them without the nose hitting the ground.  Student can rosette and carry the wing without dragging any portion of it.	</li>
<li><strong>Flight simulation:</strong>  Student can show launching while maintaining shoulders forward, settle into harness without disturbing risers, initiate turns with weight shift and stand up prior to landing.</li>
<li><strong>Training Hill:</strong>  Student will show the ability to consistently launch on a steep slope without frontals and without jumping, using air speed instead of brakes to launch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Solo Flight Standards:</h4>
<ol><li><strong>Big Ears:</strong>  Students can perform big ears (symmetric tip folds) to increase sink rate and can re-open with authority.</li>
<li><strong>Weight Shift Steering:</strong>  Students can make 90 degree turns in both directions with no application of brakes. </li>
<li><strong>One Handed Steering:</strong>  Students can make S-turns with one handed steering.</li>

<li><strong>60 degree turns:</strong>  Students can make 360 degree turns with at least 200 feet of clearance from the hill in both directions at various bank angles with smooth transitions from initiation of the turn to coming out of the turn.</li>
<li><strong>Speed adjustments:</strong>  Student can smoothly transition between trim and min sink without application of the speed bar.</li>
<li><strong>Speed Bar System:</strong> Students can apply speed bar to increase the angle of attack in flight and transition smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>Flight Path modification:</strong>  Student can modify their flight path according to their height to make adjustments for ridge clearance, other pilots and/or Landing zone approaches.</li></ol>
<h4>Landing Standards:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Landing:</strong>  Student consistently lands on their feet, with proper flare timing and does not induce parachutal stall prior to touching down.</li>
<li><strong>Spot landings:</strong>  Student can land within 25 feet of a cone in a designated area of the landing zone from more than 200' above without instruction. Student must touch down and come to rest within the 25 foot radius.</li>
