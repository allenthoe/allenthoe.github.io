iv.	Off the Road or Gavin’s launch (need to walk about ¼ mile)
v.	SW preferred, works often when Marshall is North because of the wind shelter of Big Bear Mountain.
vi.	Non-Rated, Non-Controlled.  Recommend P3 with Restricted Landing Field sign off.
d.	Pisgha

vii.	P3 recommended
e.	Elsinore
i.	None
ii.	Downhill sloped LZ which can be thermic and is somewhat restricted (by trees and a road to the NorthWest.  Can land on the beach as a bailout if conditions are strong and you want to descend over water.  
iii.	Drive up the road.
iv.	North – East works well.
v.	P3 + recommended.  Strong Thermic and convergence site.  Launches are usually early in the day (around noon or earlier) and can be long, high flights.  Recommend that any pilots flying this site have experience with turbulence, active piloting and RLF.
f.	Winchester Bowl
i.	None
ii.	
iii.	South
iv.	Main Launch is cleared spot in middle of the hill.  You can park close but need to hike about 10 minutes to the flag.  Launching the top is an option but if it’s working lower there’s no need.  The conditions are either on or off, and hiking to the top will rarely make a difference.
